# Product Requirements Document

## Title
Document Management Web App

## Overview
A modular web application that allows users to upload files via a web interface or API, with support for file type and size validation. Designed for fast iteration, developer collaboration, and future extensibility.

## Core Features
- 📤 Upload documents via UI and API
- ✅ Validate file types and enforce max size
- ❌ Graceful error handling for invalid uploads
- 🧪 Automated tests for upload and validation logic

## Future Features (Not in current scope)
- 🔐 Secure file sharing (via expiring links or user permissions)
- 🔍 OCR and full-text search
- 🧾 Metadata extraction and categorization

## Non-Functional Requirements
- 🖥️ Run locally via Flask for development (`flask run` or `python app.py`)
- 💾 Store uploaded files in local path (`./uploads/`)
- 🔄 Plan for a storage abstraction layer via `services/storage_service.py`
- ⚙️ Use `.env` file for environment configuration
- 🛠️ Prepare for hosting on basic platforms (e.g., Render, Railway, Fly.io)
- 🧪 Code must be testable with `pytest`

## Technical Constraints
- Python 3.11+
- No external infrastructure (e.g., S3, Kubernetes) required initially
- Minimal dependency stack to encourage adoption and maintainability
