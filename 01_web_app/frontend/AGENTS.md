# 01_web_app/Frontend Agent Guide

## Purpose
Implement and evolve the client experience for the document management app.

## Current Layout
- `src/`: placeholder for React/Vite code once the frontend is bootstrapped.
- `public/`: static assets served by the frontend build tool.

## Responsibilities
- Choose and document the tooling (e.g., Vite + React) when the frontend is initialized.
- Keep UI components accessible, responsive, and aligned with backend capabilities.
- Coordinate with backend APIs for upload flows and error handling states.
- Update this guide and any frontend README when the stack is established.

## Workflow
1. Discuss major UI or tooling decisions with the team.
2. Scaffold the frontend (e.g., via Vite) inside `src/` when ready.
3. Implement features in small, tested increments.
4. Sync with backend changes to keep UX and API behavior consistent.

## Notes
The frontend is currently a stub; flesh out this directory as the project adds user-facing views.
